# Basic Python Calculator

##  Description
This is a simple Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—based on user input. It's part of an Intro to Python assignment to practice variables, user input, and conditionals.


## Objective
- Practice writing Python code using variables and user input
- Perform arithmetic operations using `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to control logic
- Output formatted results clearly



## How It Works

The program:
1. Asks the user to enter two numbers
2. Asks the user to enter an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
3. Performs the calculation and prints the result

## Example
```text
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
